# Research Questions and Hypotheses {background-color="aquamarine"}

## Research Questions

         
**R1**: Why do people join the Credit Union?

R2: Why do members use other financial institutions when they need to borrow funds? 


. . . 

R3: What are the members’ attitudes and beliefs about the proficiencies of credit union employees?

R4: Are there any perceived differences on attitude towards employee proficiencies, awareness of services, and operational effectiveness between members who live in the area of the firm’s headquarters and members who live elsewhere?


. . . 

R5: How well are the members aware of the services offered by the credit union?

R6: What are the members’ attitudes and beliefs about how effectively the credit union is operated?


## Hypotheses

### H1 - H3

::: {.medium-text}        
H1: Members’ `awareness of the regular share accounts` will influence their opinions on the `adequacy of financial services` in meeting members’ needs.

H2: Members will not be different in their opinion on CU’s loan rate (Q8r) and the degree to which they agree that CU’s loan rate is lower than competitors (Q30).

H3a: There will be interaction effect between the current loan use and location of residence on adequacy of current financial services such that in headquarter area, members who have a loan will agree, more than those who don’t have, that financial services meet the members’ needs, while in outside headquarter area, loan status doesn’t influence adequacy of financial services in meeting member needs.

H3b: Test H2a controlling for the impact of attitudes toward employee proficiency.
:::

---

### H4 & H5

::: {.medium-text}        
H4: Compared with the members who have a loan, [those members who don’t have a loan]{style="color:red;"} currently with the Credit Union will feel that that CU charges them with higher rates, and that they will agree less with the statement that CU’s loan rates are lower than those offered by other institutions.

H5a: Member belief about CU keeps personal financial information confidential will positively influence the overall attitude toward credit union’s operational efficiency.

H5b: Loan application processing promptness will positively influence the overall attitude toward credit union’s operational efficiency.

H5c: Member satisfaction with level of financial services in meeting needs will positively influence the overall attitude toward credit union’s operational efficiency.

H5d: Loan application simplicity and easiness will positively influence the overall attitude toward credit union’s operational efficiency.

# R1 {background-color="aquamarine"} 

R1: Why do people join the Credit Union?

- Constructs and roles: reasons for why people join the credit uniion
- Operationalization:
  q7r (Savings rates)
- Scale:
  - 1-5 point, Likert-type scale
- Statistics:
  - Descriptive statistics, followed by one sample t-test
  
## Descriptive Statistics

```{r}
data |> 
  count(q7r) |> 
  mutate(percent = n/sum(n))

```{r}

## Insights about R1

- The majority of the survey participants (`65%`) think that the savings rate the CU offers is average.
- The **`sample mean`** is `3.07`, which is not statistically different from 3 ("average") (_p_ > .10).

# R2 {background-color="aquamarine"}

R2: Why do members use other financial institutions when they need to borrow funds?

# R3 {background-color="aquamarine"}

R3: What are the members’ attitudes and beliefs about the proficiency of credit union employees?

-   Constructs and roles: Attitudes toward employee proficiencies
-   Operationalization:
    -   q3, q4, q5, q6 --\> at_emp
-   Scale: interval scale: 1-5 point, Likert-type scale
-   Statistics:
    -   Descriptive statistics
    -   Reliabilty/factor analysis,
    -   one-sample t-test

## Descriptive Statistics

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Histogram

```{r}
#| output-location: slide

  ggplot(aes(at_emp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = "black", fill = "lightblue") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(at_emp, na.rm = TRUE)),

  geom_text(aes(x = mean(at_emp, na.rm = TRUE), y = 30, 
                label = paste0("Mean = ", round(mean(at_emp), 2))),
            color = "red", angle = 90, vjust = -0.5, hjust = 2.2) +

       y = "Count") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(0, NA))
  
```

## Reliability/factor analysis

-   We already looked at reliability and unidimensionality.
-   The four items are highly representative of the latent construct.
-   Therefore, we created a compositie index and use it

## one-sample t-test

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
data |> 
  t.test(at_emp ~ 1, mu = 4, data = _)
```

## Summary insights about R3

Participants perceived Employee proficiency is 4.21 on average out of 5.0 and is greater than 4.0 ("Agree")
:::

# R4 {background-color="aquamarine"}

### Descriptives

#### Boxplot

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
data |> 
  mutate(q38 = haven::as_factor(q38)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(q38, at_emp, fill = q38)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Live in HQ Area",
       y = "Attitudes toward Employee Proficiency",
       title = "Does Employee Proficiency differ by where customers live?") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Barplot

```{r}
#| output-location: slide
data |> 
  mutate(q38 = haven::as_factor(q38)) |> 
  group_by(q38) |> 
  summarize(mean = mean(at_emp, na.rm = TRUE)) |>

       y = "Attitudes toward Employee Proficiency",
       title = "Does Employee Proficiency differ by where customers live?") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Two independent sample t-test

```{r}
# check for equal variance
library(car)

data |> 
  mutate(q38 = haven::as_factor(q38)) |> 
  leveneTest(at_emp ~ q38, data = _)

data |> 
  mutate(q38 = haven::as_factor(q38)) |> 
  var.test(at_emp ~ q38, data = _)

# t.test: assuming var are equal
data |> 
  t.test(at_emp ~ q38, data = _, var.equal = TRUE) 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: callout-note
### Summary insights about H4a

The group mean value on employee proficiency for customers who live in HQ and those who live elsewhere are not statistically different.

Thus, we conclude that the location of customer residence is not associated with their perception of CU employee proficiency.
