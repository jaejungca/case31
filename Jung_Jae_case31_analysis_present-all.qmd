# Introduction {background-color="#a13c65"}

- Employees Federal Union (EFCU) is the credit unio for a Fortune 500 firm.

## Problem Definition

- CU has a large amount of surplus fund. 
- It has also experienced a lower loan/share ratio than otehr credit unions of similar size. 
- Average earnings on its investments have declined and profit margins are squeezed
 
## Research Objectives

1. To determine why its members are not borrowing money from the credit union. 
2. To determine what the members' attitudes were toward the overall management and operations of the credit union. 

## Significance of Research

- The findings from the research will provide critical inforamtion that the managment can use to increase loan/ratio rate and increase profit margin.
- Thus, the the research is critical in turning around the company's struggling financial status.

# Background and Research Questions/Hypotheses {background-color="#a13c65"}

## Information gathering

::: {.incremental}
- To address the research objectives, a research firm was hired. 
- The researchers from the consulting company interviewed the management and some customers.
- Based on the qualitative research and the researchers' own experience, they came up with some research questions and hypotheses.
:::

## Research Questions

**R1**: Why do people join the Credit Union?

R2: Why do members use other financial institutions when they need to borrow funds? 


. . . 

R3: What are the members’ attitudes and beliefs about the proficiencies of credit union employees?

R4: Are there any perceived differences on attitude towards employee proficiencies, awareness of services, and operational effectiveness between members who live in the area of the firm’s headquarters and members who live elsewhere?


. . . 

R5: How well are the members aware of the services offered by the credit union?

R6: What are the members’ attitudes and beliefs about how effectively the credit union is operated?


## Hypotheses

### H1 - H3

::: {.medium-text}        
H1: Members’ `awareness of the regular share accounts` will influence their opinions on the `adequacy of financial services` in meeting members’ needs.

H2: Members will not be different in their opinion on CU’s loan rate (Q8r) and the degree to which they agree that CU’s loan rate is lower than competitors (Q30).

H3a: There will be interaction effect between the current loan use and location of residence on adequacy of current financial services such that in headquarter area, members who have a loan will agree, more than those who don’t have, that financial services meet the members’ needs, while in outside headquarter area, loan status doesn’t influence adequacy of financial services in meeting member needs.

H3b: Test H2a controlling for the impact of attitudes toward employee proficiency.
:::

---

### H4 & H5

::: {.medium-text}        
H4: Compared with the members who have a loan, [those members who don’t have a loan]{style="color:red;"} currently with the Credit Union will feel that that CU charges them with higher rates, and that they will agree less with the statement that CU’s loan rates are lower than those offered by other institutions.

H5a: Member belief about CU keeps personal financial information confidential will positively influence the overall attitude toward credit union’s operational efficiency.

H5b: Loan application processing promptness will positively influence the overall attitude toward credit union’s operational efficiency.

H5c: Member satisfaction with level of financial services in meeting needs will positively influence the overall attitude toward credit union’s operational efficiency.

H5d: Loan application simplicity and easiness will positively influence the overall attitude toward credit union’s operational efficiency.

# `r fontawesome::fa("laptop-code", "white")` Methods {background-color="#447099"}

## Research Design

- A `mail survey` was used due to the following reasons:
  - CU membership is widely dispersed geographically
  - Low cost
  - Sensitive questions needs anonymity to induce a candid response
  - Long time needed for mail survey is not an issue for the board.

. . .

- Questions were mostly `structured` with several key questions asked in `unstructured` format

. . .

- `Likert-type` scales were used for attitudes measurements.

## Population and Sampling

- `Population`: All current members of the EFCU.
- `Sampling frame`: 
  - A list of members and their addresses is available.
  - 3,531 members as of January 31 for trial balance listing of the EFCU membership

. . .

- `Sampling method`: _Simple random sampling_
  - `Sample size`: 300
    - Calculation: was done using estimated` population standard deviation` based on responses of 15 members to Q37.
    - 300 random numbers were generated within the range of 1 to 3,531 members.
    - Each random number was matched with the corresponding number in the sampling frame.

## Data Collection and coding

:::{.incremental}
- Preparatoin of all copies of survey and mailing them were handled by the CU's staff members.
- The structured questions in the survey were coded based on the classifications established by researchers
- Questionnaire responses were examined for the integrity, and a few responses of low quality were excluded
:::

## Data Preparation

- Used R/RStudio for wrangling and visualization

. . .

::: {.incremental}
- Data `wrangling and preparation` was done separately. Specifically, we did the following
  - `Reverse coded`
  - Removed non-responses (`NA`)
  - Removed `Not Applicable responses` from otherwise Likert-type interval scales to make them suitable for continuous variables (e.g., 1-5 piont scale)
  - Renamed variable names
  - Relabeled variable labels and value labels if needed.
  - The prepared data is saved as `Case 31 Data_efcu_Prepped.sav`, which will be used for data analysis.

# Addressing R1 {background-color="aquamarine"} 

**R1: Why do people join the Credit Union?**

- `Constructs and roles`: reasons for why people join the Credit Union
- `Operationalization`:
  q7r (Savings rates)
- `Scales:`
  - 1-5 point, Likert-type scale
- `Statistics to be used`:
  - Descriptive statistics, followed by one sample t-test

## Insights about R1

- The majority of the survey participants (`65%`) think that the savings rate the CU offers is average.
- The **`sample mean`** is `3.07`, which is not statistically different from 3 ("average") (*p* > .10).
- Thus, we can conclude that CU members seems to think that the savings rate CU applies to them is about average.

  - q30 (CU rates lower)
- `Scales:`
  - 1-5 point, Likert-type scales

-   `Constructs and roles`: Attitudes toward employee proficiency
-   `Operationalization`:
    -   q3, q4, q5, q6 --\> at_emp
-   `Scale: interval scale`: 1-5 point, Likert-type scale

       x = "Employee Prociency",
       y = "Count") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(0, NA))
  
```

## Reliability/factor analysis

-   We already looked at reliability and unidimensionality in the data preparatoin stage.
-   The four items are highly representative of the latent construct.
-   Therefore, we created a `composite index` and use it

## One-sample t-test

::: {.medium-text}

- $H_0: \mu = 4$
- $H_1: \mu \neq 4$

```{r}

# Test of H2 {background-color="black"}

H2: Members will not be different in their opinion on CU’s loan rate (Q8r) and the degree to which they agree that CU’s loan rate is lower than competitors (Q30).

# Test of H3a {background-color="black"}

H3a: There will be interaction effect between the current loan use and location of residence on adequacy of current financial services such that in headquarter area, members who have a loan will agree, more than those who don’t have, that financial services meet the members’ needs, while in outside headquarter area, loan status doesn’t influence adequacy of financial services in meeting member needs.

# Test of H3b {background-color="black"}

H3b: Test H2a controlling for the impact of attitudes toward employee proficiency.

# Test of H4 {background-color="black"}

H4: Compared with the members who have a loan, [those members who don’t have a loan]{style="color:red;"} currently with the Credit Union will feel that that CU charges them with higher rates, and that they will agree less with the statement that CU’s loan rates are lower than those offered by other institutions.

# Test of H5 {background-color="black"}

::: {.small-text}
H5a: Member belief about CU keeps personal `financial information confidential` will positively influence the [overall attitude toward credit union’s operational efficiency]{style="color:orange;"}.

H5b: `Loan application processing promptness` will positively influence the overall attitude toward credit union’s operational efficiency.

H5c: `Member satisfaction with level of financial services in meeting needs` will positively influence the overall attitude toward credit union’s operational efficiency.

H5d: `Loan application simplicity and easiness` will positively influence the overall attitude toward credit union’s operational efficiency.
